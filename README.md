## Java Pattern Problems Repository

Welcome to the Java Pattern Problems Repository! This repository is designed to provide a collection of Java programs focusing on pattern-based problem-solving. Patterns are a fundamental aspect of programming and mastering pattern-based problems can greatly enhance your problem-solving skills.

### What's Included?

- **Various Pattern Problems**: Explore a diverse set of pattern problems (STAR, NUMBER, CHARACTER/ ALPHABETICAL) ranging from simple shapes to complex designs.
- **Clear Explanations**: Each problem is accompanied by clear explanations and comments to help you understand the solution approach.
- **Multiple Difficulty Levels**: Problems are categorized based on difficulty levels to cater to learners of all levels, from beginners to advanced.

### Tips & Tricks to solve any Pattern Problem

// **Solve Any Star Pattern Question With This Trick**
        Steps:-
        1. Run the outer for loop, the no. of times you are having the lines! (no. of lines = no. of rows = no. of times outer for loop will run)
        2. Identify for every row no. (- How many columns are there.) and run the inner loop accordingly.
        3. What do you need to print!
        Note: Put the println() statement as the last statement of the outer loop to change the line!

// **Solve Any Number Pattern Question With This Trick**
        Steps:-
        > The shape & the numbers there inside the shape make up the number pattern problem.
        > Identify the pattern and the numbers in it.
        1. Run the outer for loop, the no. of times you are having the lines! (no. of lines = no. of rows = no. of times outer for loop will run)
        2. Identify for every row no. (- How many columns are there.) and run the inner loop accordingly.
        3. What do you need to print!
        Note: Put the println() statement as the last statement of the outer loop to change the line!

// **Solve Any Character Pattern Question With This Trick**
        Steps:-
        > The shape & the characters/ alphabets there inside the shape make up the character pattern problem.
        > Identify the pattern and the characters in it.
        1. Run the outer for loop, the no. of times you are having the lines! (no. of lines = no. of rows = no. of times outer for loop will run)
        2. Identify for every row no. (- How many columns are there.) and run the inner loop accordingly.
        3. What do you need to print!
        Note: Put the println() statement as the last statement of the outer loop to change the line!
